The Company may provide information on the price, volatility of Tokens and events that have affected the price of Tokens, however such information should not be considered as investment or other financial advice and should not be construed as such.

                          <li>The User confirms that he/she is aware of the following risks associated with trading on the Platform:
                          </li>
                      </ul>
                      <ul class="alpha-list">
                          <li> <strong>Risk of Losing Access to Tokens Due to Loss of Private Key(s):</strong>  A private key, or a combination of private keys, is necessary to control and dispose of Tokens stored in your digital wallet or vault. Accordingly, loss of requisite private key(s) associated with your digital wallet or vault will result in the loss of such Tokens. Moreover, any third party that gains access to such private key(s), including by gaining access to login credentials of a hosted wallet service you use, may be able to misappropriate your Tokens.
                          </li>
                          <li> <strong> Risks Associated with the Ethereum blockchain: </strong> Since Tokens are based on the Ethereum blockchain, any malfunction, breakdown or abandonment of the Ethereum protocol or other technological difficulties may have a material adverse effect on or prevent access to or use of the Platform or Tokens. Moreover, advances in cryptography,  or technical advances such as the development of quantum computing, could present risks to the Tokens and the Platform  by rendering ineffective the cryptographic consensus mechanism that underpins the Ethereum blockchain. Transactions involving Tokens on the blockchain may be irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable.
                          </li>
                          <li> <strong>Risk of Hacking and Security Weaknesses: </strong> Hackers or other malicious groups or organisations may attempt to interfere with the Platform or Tokens in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks,Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing.
                          </li>
                          <li> <strong>Risks Associated with Markets for Tokens : </strong>If the trading of Tokens is facilitated by third party exchanges, such exchanges may be relatively new and subject to little or no regulatory oversight, making them more susceptible to fraud or manipulation. Tokens are not legal tender and are not backed by government.
                          </li>
                          <li><strong>Risk of Uninsured Losses: </strong> Unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions, Tokens are uninsured unless you specifically obtain private insurance to insure them. Thus, in the event of loss or loss of utility value, there is no public insurer or private insurance arranged by the Company, to offer recourse to you.
                          </li>
                          <li> <strong>Risks Associated with Uncertain Regulations and Enforcement Actions : </strong>The regulatory status of the Tokens, the Services provided via the Platform and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulation with respect to such technology and its applications, including the Platform and the Tokens.
                          </li>
                          <li> <strong>Risks Associated with Changes in Regulations : </strong> It is difficult to predict how or whether legislatures or regulatory agencies may implement changes to law and regulation affecting distributed ledger technology and its applications, including the Platform and the Tokens. <br><br>
                            New or revised legislation, regulations, administrative directives or guidelines issued by regulators, and regulatory actions could negatively impact the Platform and the Tokens in various ways. The Company may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s)to operate in such jurisdiction.
                          </li>
                          <li> <strong>Risks Arising from Taxation: </strong>The tax characterisation of Tokens is  uncertain. The User agrees that he/she shall seek tax advice in connection with purchasing Tokens, which may result in adverse tax consequences to the User, including due to the applicability of withholding taxes, income taxes and tax reporting requirements.
                          </li>
                          <li> <strong>Risk of Insufficient Interest in the Platform: </strong>It is possible that the  Platform will not be used by a large enough number of individuals, companies and other entities. Such a lack of use or interest could negatively impact the extended use of the Platform and therefore the potential utility of Tokens.
                          </li>
                          <li> <strong>Risk of Dissolution of the Company: </strong> It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, an unfavourable  fluctuation in the value of Ether (or other cryptographic and fiat currencies), the failure of commercial relationships, or intellectual property ownership challenges, the Platform may no longer be viable to operate and the Company may dissolve.
                          </li>
                          <li> <strong>Risks Arising from Lack of Governance Rights: </strong>As Tokens confer no governance rights of any kind with respect to the Platform or the Company or its corporate affiliates, all decisions involving the Platform or the Company will be made by the Company in its sole discretion, including, but not limited to, decisions to discontinue the Platform, to create and sell more Tokens, or to sell or liquidate the Company. These decisions could adversely affect the Platform and the Tokens you hold.
                          </li>
                          <li> <strong>Unanticipated Risks: </strong> Cryptographic tokens such as the Tokens are a new and untested technology. In addition to the above-mentioned risks, there are other risks associated with the purchase, holding and use of Tokens, including those that the Company cannot anticipate. Such risks may further materialise as unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks discussed herein.
                          </li>
                          <li> <strong>Intellectual Property Claims: </strong>Intellectual property rights claims may adversely affect the operation of the Platform. Third parties may assert intellectual property claims relating to the holding and transfer of digital assets and their source code. Regardless of the merit of any intellectual property or other legal action, any threatened action that reduces confidence in the Platform’s long-term viability may adversely affect the value of the Company, Platform, or Tokens. Additionally, a meritorious intellectual property claim could prevent you from accessing the Platform.
                          </li>
                          <li> <strong>Risks of Website content: </strong>Although the Company takes steps to provide accurate and timely information on the Website and the Platform, the information contained may not always be entirely accurate, complete or current, and may also include technical inaccuracies or typographical errors. Therefore, you should verify all such information before relying on it, and all decisions based on such information available on the Website and/or the Platform shall be at your sole responsibility and risk, and the Company shall not have any liability.
                          </li>
                          <li> <strong>Risks of Third Party Information: </strong>The Website and/or the Platform may contain references or links to third-party materials (including without limitation websites) and third-party applications which are not controlled by the Company. Such information, links, and third-party applications are provided for your convenience, and should not be considered to be endorsements, recommendations, approval, affiliations, or sponsorship of the Company of such third-party information, materials, product, service, or process, and you acknowledge and agree that the Company shall not be responsible for any such information, content, or service.
